## Description

When you load my portfolio you will find a single-page application with a header, an about me section, a section for my projects and a contact form. 

When you click one of the links in the NavBar, it will take you to the corresponding section or if you click resume, you can view my resume and download it. 

When you click on projects, you will find a list of six of my applications with links to the deployed application as well as the Github Repository.

When you click to contact me, there will be a form and if you don't fill out a form properly or enter an invalid address, you will be notified. 

You can find my Linked In and my Github Repo in the footer as well
